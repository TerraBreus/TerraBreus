    Learn how to solve and understand problems instead of googling for solutions.
    Learn to fail and fail to learn. Recognize the opportunities for growth in failure.
    Do before you think, then think before you do again.
    IMPERFECTION != FAILURE. Understand when a project is finished.
    Authenticity over conformity.
