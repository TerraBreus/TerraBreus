                <code align = center>Hi! My name is Zachary but in most (online) places I go by the name of TerraBreus! 
I currently live in Amsterdam and am halfway through my twenties. In 2024 I started the school42 curriculum at CODAM which I expect to finish by the end of 2026. I am a big fan of alive internet theory and robust, 'simple' and opensource technology that does what you want it to do. I believe that technology should make our lifes richer and more versatile - instead of leading us to monotony and conformity.</code>

But it's easy to only take and never give. My reviews are a way of giving back and allowing myself to think and reflect on what I have consumed.</code></td></tr>
