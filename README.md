                <code align = center>Hi! My name is Zachary but in most (online) places I go by the name of TerraBreus! 
I currently live in Amsterdam and am halfway through my twenties. In 2024 I started the school42 curriculum at CODAM which I expect to finish by the end of 2026. I am a big fan of alive internet theory and robust, 'simple' and opensource technology that does what you want it to do. Have people use technology and not the other way around!</code>

                <code align = center>I consider myself very lucky to have born early enough to just about catch a glimpse of life before the digital revolution. Growing up I very quickly discovered my interest in technology. Maybe this was due to my father being a programmer or me not being 'cool' enough to hang out with the non-geek kids but I spend <b>a lot</b> of my youth playing videogames. I went from playing Lego Trains on my parents old desktop to Mario Kart on the GBA to playing Minecraft on my iMac to CounterStrike GO on my first selfmade PC to... spending all this time behind a screen might have not been the best for my physical and mental health, but I did learn to love and work with technology. As I leaned towards my twenties my interest in videogames faded. However I still was as dependent and used to technology. Hours were spent on YouTube or Netflix and when I wasn't on my laptop or PC, I would be on my phone either texting with friends or scrolling on instagram. Technology passified me! 
With the introduction of AI this only escalated. In times when I was supposed to put my brain to use, chatGPT could do it for me. I was becoming a zombie.</code>

But it's easy to only take and never give. My reviews are a way of giving back and allowing myself to think and reflect on what I have consumed.</code></td></tr>
